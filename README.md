# connect474

My final Project for Computational Intelligence for Games (CPSC 474) at Yale University. 

It models a Connect 4 game and includes 2 agents:   
A Monte Carlo Tree Search agent and a Minimax agent with alpha-beta pruning (depth 5).   
   
Run "./connect474 -h" for instructions on how to run the program and information about the modes that are available.
